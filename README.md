# CodeQuiz

The fourth homework was to create a quiz using JavaScript, with a countdown timer and a way to store your score. 

## Pseudocode

The following is my thought process for what I needed to happen.
- When the user clicks the start button, the quiz and timer will start and the user will be presented with a question and 4 answers to choose from.
- If they choose the right answer, it moves on to the next question; if they choose the wrong answer 10 seconds is deducted and they move on to the next question.
- The quiz ends when all of the questions have been answered or time has ran out. 
- The amount of time left is taken and used as a score which the user can store with their initials


Based on this my code would have to - 
- Display an introductory page with a 'start' button.
- Once the button has been clicked, the quiz will start.
- The code will cycle through an array of questions
- The timer will count down from 60 and time will be deducted if an answer is wrong.
- The timer will count down to 0 and end the quiz; all the questions will be answered to end the quiz.
- When the user has finished the quiz, they are shown their score, which is the time remaining, and prompted to enter their initials.
- These initials and score are then stored in local storage. 

## Difficulties

This was the hardest assignment so far, I only managed to make the timer and game over prompt show up at 0. I struggled a lot with how to show and hide elements, how to cycle through the questions, and didn't even make it to the score and storing part. It was also difficult trying to keep track of and remember the amount of variables and ID's that were in use and what each one did, which contributed to the difficulty in making the script as I wasn't sure what ID or var I should be referencing. 

## Overall thoughts

I had to do a lot of independent research to figure out how to do this assignment and unfortunately I ran out of time. I want to try this assignment again when I know more about JavaScript, and I think with further practice I would be able to make the quiz.
